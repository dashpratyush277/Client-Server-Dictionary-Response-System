The project, "Client-Server Dictionary Generation System Using Java Socket Programming," aims to develop a networked application that allows clients to generate and query a dictionary from a centralized server. 
Utilizing Java's robust socket programming capabilities, the system establishes a TCP/IP connection between multiple clients and a dedicated server. 
The server handles requests from clients to add, delete, or retrieve word definitions in real-time, ensuring data consistency and availability. 
The server maintains the dictionary data structure, while clients interact through a user-friendly interface. 
This architecture not only enhances the efficiency of dictionary management but also demonstrates key concepts of network communication, concurrency, and distributed computing in Java. 
The project underscores the importance of socket programming in building scalable and interactive applications.
